# Mahshid Ahmadi Thesis Scripts

A collection of scripts and tools developed for the Master's thesis **"Species Interaction Network Discovery Using LLMs Across Scientific Papers"**. This repository includes code for data preprocessing, model inference, evaluation, and visualization used during the research and experimentation process.


## Project Overview

This repository supports the thesis project focused on extracting species names and their ecological relationships from scientific literature using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline includes:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using few-shot prompting and fine-tuning,
- Relation Extraction (RE) using Few-shot prompting interaction extraction,
- Knowledge Graph Construction of species interaction networks.

## Features

- ðŸ“‘ **NER Pipeline:** Species name detection using LLaMA-based models and evaluation with multiple matching metrics.
- ðŸ”— **Relation Extraction:** Extraction of ecological relationships between species from scientific text.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Evaluation Tools:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Error Rate calculators.
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization Scripts:** Graph-based visualizations for interaction networks.
